# 02_Igniting our App

## After Package.json file we are installing our Dependencies

## The most important Package is **bundler**

when we have file's like _html_ _css_ _javascript_ our whole code need to **bundle** together our whole code need to be **minified**, **cached**, **compressed**, **clean** 
before it can be send to **production**

## So **bundler** can do all sort of things.

## **bunlder** also known as **WebPack**

When we say bundler is known for WebPack, Parcel, Vite. and there are more bundler out there this are bundlers.


## What is job of bundler ?

bundler basically, bundle our app and its packages our app properly so it can be shipped to production.

## When we say 

```bash
  create-react-app 
```
This create-react-app uses **webpack** & **babel** behind the scene.


### there are two type of packages.

1. Normal Dependencies - use in production.
2. Dev Dependencies - use in developemnet.

### We install Parcel Package.

### Parcel is a BEAST.
